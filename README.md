# respwner_like_KARLSON
That's my Karlsonn's respawner code. create new object and change scale. You create as many spawner objecting tags and add a separate tag to each one, and as many spawner objectings add as many spawner codes to the player, write the names of the desired tags, select the desired spawner empty objects and everything works
